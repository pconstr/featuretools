    "Handling Time\n",
    "=============\n",
    "\n",
    "Time is a naturally relevant factor in many predictive modeling problems. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How much revenue will I bring in next month?\n",
    "2. What is the expected delay on my next flight?\n",
    "3. Will my user purchase an upgrade to their membership?\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to estimate how effective you are at predicting revenue would be to see how you would have done predicting it last month or the month before. You would similarly be interested in checking if you were able to predict the delay on your previous flight, or how good you are historically at detecting customers who would upgrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is immensely tricky to make a feature matrix by hand for those predictions. To create historical predictions you need to set a **time** to make a prediction for every row and then **cut off** any data in your dataset that happens after that time. Then, you can use the remaining valid data to make any features you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most powerful functionality in Featuretools is the ability to accurately and precisely handle time. To make the most of that functionality, it is necessary to understand how :ref:`provided times <representing-time>` will be used."
